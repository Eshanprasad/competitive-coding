vehicles = int(input('enter the number of vehicles:'))
wheels = int(input('enter the number of wheels:'))


# (x/4) + (y/2) = vehicles  (total number of vehicles)     in this equation x/4 = number of 4 wheelers, y/2 = number of 2 wheelers
# x + y = Wheels            (total number of wheels)



# by solving the above two equations we get below two equations



y = (4*vehicles) - wheels
x = wheels - y
print('number of two - wheelers:',y/2)
print('number of 4- wheelers:',x/4)
