Question 1:

A vendor offers software services to a client. Each resource is billed at some dollar rate per hour. The total cost of the project for the client is therefore, the total number of hours contributed by all the vendor resources * the dollar rate / hour. There are however some variants.

a. The vendor might have purchased hardware/infrastructure or software licenses needed for the project.  
b. The vendor might have utilized external consultants for the project. 
c. The client looks at the vendor as a one stop solution and hence external resources employed by the vendor need to be paid by the vendor. 
d. It might however be possible that the vendorâ€™s hardware and software purchases are borne by the client. In this case, the client pays the vendor 30% of the hardware/infrastructure costs. In case of software licenses, the client pays the vendor 50% of the cost, if they are commonly available and used, or 100% if the software is infrequently used or is proprietary client technology. 
e. The external consultants employed by the vendor will come at a dollar rate per hour. 
f. Accept the suitable inputs and display the profits / loss realized by the vendor.
