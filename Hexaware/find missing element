"""
You are given 3 Arrays of size N, N-1 , N-2 namely A, B, C respectively .
you have to print two integers x and y in separate line such that:

1. Xis a element of A but not of B.
2. Y is a element of B but not of C.

Input format:
* First line denotes an Integer N
* 2nd line consist of N space separated integer denoting elements of A

* 3rd line consist of N-1 space separated integer denoting elements of B

* 4th line consist of N-2 space separated integer denoting elements of C

Example :
3
123
23
2
Output
1
